/* CHALLENGE
Given a string of text, return the number of vowels found within the text
e.g vowelsCounter('anehizxcv') // will return 3
*/

//pseudoCode breakdown
    //We write a function thatâ€™d receive a parameter called text. It would be a string of any length which would be passed to the function as an argument when it is called.

    // Next, within the function we have to go through the text and search for occurrences of the English vowels (a,e,i,o,u).

    // The function then returns the total number of matches(vowels) found. This brings return statements to mind as they simply stop the execution of a function and return a value from that function.

//2 ways of solving this

    //an iterative approach
        //

    //using regular expressions


function vowelsCounter(text) {
    // Code goes here
}
